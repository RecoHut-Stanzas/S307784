        "| Problem | Real-time event capturing is important in recommender systems because consumer behavior and underlying patterns changes rapidly. But how to capture these events in real-time? |\n",
        "| Solution | There are many tools and technologies to capture events (clickstream) in real-time and also train/infer real-time recommendations. Kafka + MongoDB is one such set of tools/techs for this objective. We will use Kafka producer at the user's endpoint to send the events to a Kafka consumer/listener via a relevant topic stream (called Kafka topic). Then this received events can directly be fed into recsys training process. We will store these events in MongoDB for long-term persistence. |\n",

        "| Preprocessing | We will convert the records into JSON format. |\n",

Left is the producer who is sending the JSON to Kafka broker, the center is the consumer who is subscribed to the topic and receiving the messages in real-time. And on the right side, we have a MongoDB listener which is connected to MongoDB, listening to the events and converting them into a pandas data frame. \n",
